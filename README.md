# ODE and PDE Solvers with Neural Networks

This repository contains three code examples that demonstrate how to use neural networks to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Each code example focuses on a different type of equation and neural network implementation. Below are descriptions and details for each of the code examples:

## Polynomial ODE Solver

### Description

The Polynomial ODE Solver showcases the use of a scikit-learn MLPRegressor neural network to solve ODEs for polynomial functions. The code implements a neural network architecture to approximate ODE solutions and visualizes the results using Matplotlib.

## Differential Equation Approximator

### Description

The Differential Equation Approximator demonstrates how to solve ODEs and PDEs using TensorFlow and JAX. Custom loss functions are employed to approximate derivatives and solve differential equations. The code visualizes the results by comparing the neural network's output with the exact solution.

## Custom ODE/PDE Solver

### Description

The Custom ODE/PDE Solver explores a custom neural network architecture to solve ODEs and PDEs with unique weight and bias configurations. JAX is used to implement the network, showcasing its capability to solve specific mathematical equations. The code also visualizes the results by plotting the network's output against the exact solutions.
